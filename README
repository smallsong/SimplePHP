SimplePHP Framework

This is a simple and clear framework designed for php5.3+ with full OOP support.
When I was preparing my graduation project, I want to find a php framework that
I can fully use the new features of php5.3+. But almost all php frameworks keep
themselves compatible with lower version of php, so I can not use namespace to 
manage the classes(actually namespace makes no good to use in those frameworks).
As a result, I decided to write a new framework to meet my needs.

As a full object oriented framework, classes is treated as the smallest unit.
We never write functions outside a class. A root application object manage the 
whole lifecycle of the runtime objects. It seems that it is a Java EE framework.
Actually, I "copied" some features to this php framework and it works well :-).

Case tools can effectively help you to DESIGN a system rather than WRITE a system.
But unfortunately less case tools support php5.3+'s forward or reverse engineering.
If you build a open source UML tools(of course with php5.3+ support), I will be 
very grateful.

When I was writing my thesis, I promised to open the framework's source code to
public. Now I fulfilled my promise, the framework has been released with LGPLv3
licence, you can read the licence in current directory.

This framework is still in alpha test stage so far, please don't count on it 
working well without a bug. If you want to contribute to this project, please notify
me by this email address <me@starlight36.com>.
